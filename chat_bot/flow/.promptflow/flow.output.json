      "content": " Your message to meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com couldn't be delivered.A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has blocked your message.This organization does not accept emails from outside of the organization.m365x214355.onmicros. . . Office 365 meganb Action Required Recipient Blocked by mail flow rule How to Fix ItAn email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.More Info for Email AdminsStatus code: 550 5.7.1_ETR This error occurs because an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:7/19/2023 6:45:42 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Error DetailsError:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy Message rejected by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comNotification DetailsSent by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com Message HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME17/19/20236:45:50 PM[127.0.0.1]msc13.plala.or.jpESMTP8\u00a0sec27/19/20236:45:50 PMmsc13.plala.or.jpmsg12.plala.or.jpESMTP*37/19/20236:45:51 PMmsg12.plala.or.jpMW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\u00a0sec47/19/20236:45:51 PMMW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comMW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*57/19/20236:45:51 PMMW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from MW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) by CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:610:148::9) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6609.24; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from MW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7:cafe::b8) by MW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6588.33 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 60.36.166.77) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 60.36.166.77 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=60.36.166.77; helo=msg12.plala.or.jp;Received: from msg12.plala.or.jp (60.36.166.77) by MW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.31.141) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.6609.24 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from msc13.plala.or.jp ([172.23.12.103]) by msg12.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.JAL15646.msg12.plala.or.jp@msc13.plala.or.jp>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Received: from [127.0.0.1] (really [20.222.33.228]) by msc13.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.PGOJ16351.msc13.plala.or.jp@[127.0.0.1]>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"--_NmP-63074a8de64487bc-Part_1\"From: Remittance for M365x214355 <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Message-ID: <a44f0ac6-a905-f5c4-2724-affe56de2846@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>X-Priority: 1 (Highest)X-MSMail-Priority: HighImportance: HighDate: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:42 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac13; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac12; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: MW2NAM04FT060:EE_|CH3PR15MB5539:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 76f651d5-3cb0-4d2e-3179-08db88886045",
