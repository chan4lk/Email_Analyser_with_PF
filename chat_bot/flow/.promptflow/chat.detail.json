Although it\\'s possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it\\'s stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:7/19/2023 6:45:42 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Error DetailsError:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy Message rejected by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comNotification DetailsSent by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com Message HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME17/19/20236:45:50 PM[127.0.0.1]msc13.plala.or.jpESMTP8\\xa0sec27/19/20236:45:50 PMmsc13.plala.or.jpmsg12.plala.or.jpESMTP*37/19/20236:45:51 PMmsg12.plala.or.jpMW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\\xa0sec47/19/20236:45:51 PMMW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comMW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*57/19/20236:45:51 PMMW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from MW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) by CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:610:148::9) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6609.24; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from MW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7:cafe::b8) by MW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6588.33 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 60.36.166.77) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 60.36.166.77 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=60.36.166.77; helo=msg12.plala.or.jp;Received: from msg12.plala.or.jp (60.36.166.77) by MW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.31.141) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.6609.24 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from msc13.plala.or.jp ([172.23.12.103]) by msg12.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.JAL15646.msg12.plala.or.jp@msc13.plala.or.jp>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Received: from [127.0.0.1] (really [20.222.33.228]) by msc13.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.PGOJ16351.msc13.plala.or.jp@[127.0.0.1]>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"--_NmP-63074a8de64487bc-Part_1\"From: Remittance for M365x214355 <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Message-ID: <a44f0ac6-a905-f5c4-2724-affe56de2846@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>X-Priority: 1 (Highest)X-MSMail-Priority: HighImportance: HighDate: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:42 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac13; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac12; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: MW2NAM04FT060:EE_|CH3PR15MB5539:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 76f651d5-3cb0-4d2e-3179-08db88886045', 'Sentiment': 'Negative', 'Subjectivity': 0.5247899159663865}]\n\nas an examples if the json is like this,\n\n[\n    {\n      \"content\": \"Join us for an exciting product launch event where we can't contain our enthusiasm!

While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.More Info for Email AdminsStatus code: 550 5.7.1_ETR This error occurs because an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:7/19/2023 6:45:42 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Error DetailsError:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy Message rejected by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comNotification DetailsSent by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com Message HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME17/19/20236:45:50 PM[127.0.0.1]msc13.plala.or.jpESMTP8\u00a0sec27/19/20236:45:50 PMmsc13.plala.or.jpmsg12.plala.or.jpESMTP*37/19/20236:45:51 PMmsg12.plala.or.jpMW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\u00a0sec47/19/20236:45:51 PMMW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comMW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*57/19/20236:45:51 PMMW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from MW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) by CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:610:148::9) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6609.24; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from MW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7:cafe::b8) by MW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6588.33 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 60.36.166.77) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 60.36.166.77 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=60.36.166.77; helo=msg12.plala.or.jp;Received: from msg12.plala.or.jp (60.36.166.77) by MW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.31.141) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.6609.24 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from msc13.plala.or.jp ([172.23.12.103]) by msg12.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.JAL15646.msg12.plala.or.jp@msc13.plala.or.jp>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Received: from [127.0.0.1] (really [20.222.33.228]) by msc13.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.PGOJ16351.msc13.plala.or.jp@[127.0.0.1]>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"--_NmP-63074a8de64487bc-Part_1\"From: Remittance for M365x214355 <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Message-ID: <a44f0ac6-a905-f5c4-2724-affe56de2846@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>X-Priority: 1 (Highest)X-MSMail-Priority: HighImportance: HighDate: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:42 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac13; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac12; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: MW2NAM04FT060:EE_|CH3PR15MB5539:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 76f651d5-3cb0-4d2e-3179-08db88886045",

Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:7/19/2023 6:45:42 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Error DetailsError:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy Message rejected by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comNotification DetailsSent by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com Message HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME17/19/20236:45:50 PM[127.0.0.1]msc13.plala.or.jpESMTP8\u00a0sec27/19/20236:45:50 PMmsc13.plala.or.jpmsg12.plala.or.jpESMTP*37/19/20236:45:51 PMmsg12.plala.or.jpMW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\u00a0sec47/19/20236:45:51 PMMW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comMW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*57/19/20236:45:51 PMMW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from MW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) by CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:610:148::9) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6609.24; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from MW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7:cafe::b8) by MW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6588.33 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 60.36.166.77) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 60.36.166.77 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=60.36.166.77; helo=msg12.plala.or.jp;Received: from msg12.plala.or.jp (60.36.166.77) by MW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.31.141) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.6609.24 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from msc13.plala.or.jp ([172.23.12.103]) by msg12.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.JAL15646.msg12.plala.or.jp@msc13.plala.or.jp>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Received: from [127.0.0.1] (really [20.222.33.228]) by msc13.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.PGOJ16351.msc13.plala.or.jp@[127.0.0.1]>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"--_NmP-63074a8de64487bc-Part_1\"From: Remittance for M365x214355 <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Message-ID: <a44f0ac6-a905-f5c4-2724-affe56de2846@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>X-Priority: 1 (Highest)X-MSMail-Priority: HighImportance: HighDate: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:42 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac13; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac12; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: MW2NAM04FT060:EE_|CH3PR15MB5539:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 76f651d5-3cb0-4d2e-3179-08db88886045",

While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.More Info for Email AdminsStatus code: 550 5.7.1_ETR This error occurs because an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:7/19/2023 6:45:42 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Error DetailsError:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy Message rejected by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comNotification DetailsSent by:CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com Message HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME17/19/20236:45:50 PM[127.0.0.1]msc13.plala.or.jpESMTP8\u00a0sec27/19/20236:45:50 PMmsc13.plala.or.jpmsg12.plala.or.jpESMTP*37/19/20236:45:51 PMmsg12.plala.or.jpMW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\u00a0sec47/19/20236:45:51 PMMW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comMW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*57/19/20236:45:51 PMMW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from MW4PR03CA0104.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) by CH3PR15MB5539.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:610:148::9) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6609.24; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from MW2NAM04FT060.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:303:b7:cafe::b8) by MW4PR03CA0104.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:303:b7::19) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.6588.33 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 60.36.166.77) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 60.36.166.77 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=60.36.166.77; helo=msg12.plala.or.jp;Received: from msg12.plala.or.jp (60.36.166.77) by MW2NAM04FT060.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.31.141) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.6609.24 via Frontend Transport; Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:51 +0000Received: from msc13.plala.or.jp ([172.23.12.103]) by msg12.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.JAL15646.msg12.plala.or.jp@msc13.plala.or.jp>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Received: from [127.0.0.1] (really [20.222.33.228]) by msc13.plala.or.jp          with ESMTP          id <20230719184550.PGOJ16351.msc13.plala.or.jp@[127.0.0.1]>          for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>;          Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"--_NmP-63074a8de64487bc-Part_1\"From: Remittance for M365x214355 <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Approved: Completed Remittance Copy for Veronica.Mattiucci on July 18, 2023Message-ID: <a44f0ac6-a905-f5c4-2724-affe56de2846@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>X-Priority: 1 (Highest)X-MSMail-Priority: HighImportance: HighDate: Wed, 19 Jul 2023 18:45:42 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac13; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900X-VirusScan: Outbound; mvir-ac12; Thu, 20 Jul 2023 03:45:50 +0900Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: MW2NAM04FT060:EE_|CH3PR15MB5539:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 76f651d5-3cb0-4d2e-3179-08db88886045",
