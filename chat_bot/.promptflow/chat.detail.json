The Email Categories as given below with description and keywords.\nUrgent- emails are those that require immediate attention and action. They often involve time-sensitive matters that need to be addressed without delay. Examples of urgent emails include critical work-related issues, emergency requests, or messages that impact your immediate schedule or plans.\nImportant- emails are messages that hold significant relevance or value, but they may not be urgently time-bound. These emails require your attention and a timely response, but they don't demand an immediate reaction. Examples of important emails include project updates, important communications from colleagues or clients, or upcoming event notifications.\nLow-priority - emails are messages that are not particularly time-sensitive or essential. They can be addressed when you have some free time but should not take precedence over urgent or important matters. Examples of low-priority emails include newsletters, non-essential notifications, or general updates that don't require immediate action.\nEmails should be categorized based on the provided categories only.\nEach and every email message is separated with curly brackets like this {Email Message}\nPlease categorize all the given emails, list the subject, and categorization. Reason for the categorization is not required, only email subject, categories and sender are necessary.\nReturn the result table format.\n[{'Subject': 'Updates from Clean Coders Club at BISTEC Global', 'content': '\\nCAUTION: This email was sent from outside of BISTEC Global.
